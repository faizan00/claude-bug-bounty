# Bug Bounty Agent Toolkit — Plugin Guide

This repo is an agent-portable bug bounty plugin for professional hunting across HackerOne, Bugcrowd, Intigriti, and Immunefi. It supports Claude Code, OpenCode, Pi Agent, Codex-style Agent Skills, and shared `.agents/skills` harnesses.

<!-- GENERATED:tools:END -->

### Hunt Memory (in `memory/`)

<!-- GENERATED:memory:START (see docs/manifest.json — run scripts/gen_docs.py) -->
- `memory/pattern_db.py` — Cross-target pattern learning — successful techniques indexed by vuln class + tech stack (JSONL)
- `memory/vuln_intelligence.py` — CANONICAL decision engine — priority_score(), expected_value_per_hour(), duplicate_or_noise_check(), hypothesis_calibration(), tech→vuln affinity, self-learning acceptance-rate blending
- `memory/experiment_memory.py` — Granular per-payload-attempt log beneath patterns/failed_patterns — payload_category_affinity(), should_stop() (5-min-rule), suggest_pivot()
- `memory/audit_log.py` — Append-only outbound-request audit log, rate limiter, and circuit breaker for autopilot sessions
- `memory/rotation.py` — Size-based JSONL rotation (10MB cap, keep 3 backups), auto-fired on every append
- `memory/schemas.py` — Schema validation for all hunt-memory JSONL entry types (schema_version for migrations)
- `memory/finding_state.py` — Finding lifecycle state machine — SUSPECTED→TESTING→VALIDATED→CONFIRMED→SELF_CRITIQUED→REPORT_READY (+REJECTED), append-only transition log; Phase 7 gates REPORT_READY behind tools/self_critique.py's SELF_CRITIQUED state (evidence["self_critique_overall"] must be pass/warn)
- `memory/finding_score.py` — Ranks raw scanner-output lines using vuln_intelligence.priority_score() as the single scoring formula — wired into brain.py's _finding_score()/_collect_candidate_findings() (Brain's standalone-CLI triage path)
- `memory/attack_graph.py` — Typed capability graph (Asset/Endpoint/Credential/Capability/Boundary/Impact nodes) built from lead-board leads + browser intelligence, including cross-host bridging via matching cookie/storage/header value_fingerprint across two hosts; bounded N-leg DFS path search with provenance and contradiction-aware edge confidence; path_score() reuses vuln_intelligence's impact/time tables; top_paths() wired into director.py's build_plan() alongside board/browser-intel leads
- `memory/identity.py` — Phase 6 — shared reference-id scheme (entity:<type>:<id>, object:<type>:<id>, endpoint:<path>, capability:<name>) used by object_model.py/candidate.py; attack_graph.py's pre-existing endpoint:/capability: node ids call these helpers, byte-identical output
- `memory/candidate.py` — Phase 6 — canonical Candidate schema (evidence/rationale/validation_plan/provenance/state), Evidence Typing vocabulary; lead_to_candidate_view()/leads_to_candidates() retrofit existing lead-producing functions as a read-only view (never changes director.py scoring); candidate_to_lead_view() lets a Candidate-native source (object_model.py) enter director.py's existing lead pipeline
- `memory/object_model.py` — Phase 6 — application object model: User/Role/Organization/Object-type entities, OWNS/BELONGS_TO/CONTAINS/HAS_MEMBER/CAN_INVITE relationships computed ONLY from evidenced, explicitly-typed Observations (append-only ObservationStore), relationship lifecycle (created/modified/ownership_transferred/archived/deleted) evaluated against CURRENT state so legitimate transfers never false-positive; detect_relationship_violations() + rules/logic_patterns.yaml-driven detect_logic_pattern_violations() (invite flow/ownership transfer/tenant isolation/billing/refund/coupon/role escalation, one generic executor, pattern skipped entirely when required relationship evidence is missing) emit Candidates (never a priority — director.py's object_model_leads() adapter assigns skill/priority tier, same pattern as every other *_leads() adapter)
- `memory/api_call_observer.py` — Phase 7 Part A — activates object_model.py's ObservationStore with real data: observe_from_api_calls() reads recon/<target>/browser/api-calls.json and records "accessed" Observations ONLY when the exact same request URL is hit by 2+ distinct auth-fingerprint-derived actors with a 2xx response (value correlation on the whole opaque URL string, never a parsed segment/field name — api-calls.json's shape_of() already strips all concrete body values, so body-value correlation is not possible with current data); never emits a relationship-establishing event, so it supplies only the behavioral half detect_relationship_violations() needs

## Start Here

```bash
Codex
# /recon target.com
# /hunt target.com
# /validate   (after finding something)
# /report     (after validation passes)
```

## Install Skills

```bash
chmod +x install.sh && ./install.sh
```

Install for another harness:

```bash
./install.sh --agent opencode          # ~/.config/opencode/skills + commands + agents
./install.sh --agent pi                # ~/.pi/agent/skills + prompt templates
./install.sh --agent codex             # ~/.codex/skills + commands

./install.sh --agent opencode --project # local .opencode/ install
./install.sh --agent pi --project       # local .pi/ install
```

## Critical Rules (Always Active)

1. READ FULL SCOPE before touching any asset
2. NEVER hunt theoretical bugs — "Can attacker do this RIGHT NOW?"
3. Run 7-Question Gate BEFORE writing any report
4. KILL weak findings fast — N/A hurts your validity ratio
5. 5-minute rule — nothing after 5 min = move on
