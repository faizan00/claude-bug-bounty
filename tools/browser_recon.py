browser_recon.py — Browser Intelligence Layer.

Playwright-driven recon for modern SPA targets (React/Next/Angular), where a
crawler-based pipeline misses most of the real attack surface: endpoints that
only exist post-login inside a rendered app, minified bundles that hide their
original source, and route tables the crawler never triggers because nothing
links to them directly.

Playwright is an OPTIONAL dependency — deliberately NOT in requirements.txt,
same convention this codebase already uses for agent.py's langgraph/
langchain-ollama/ollama (see agent.py's own module docstring): this module
imports fine and its non-browser features (#2 source-map recovery, #3 route
extraction, #5 hidden-endpoint discovery) work with only `requests` (already
a hard dependency) when Playwright isn't installed. Browser-driven features
(#1 runtime API capture, #4 auth-model analysis) call require_playwright()
first and raise a clear, actionable error instead of crashing.

ONE-TIME SETUP for #1/#4 (two steps — easy to do only the first and wonder
why nothing works):
    python3 -m pip install playwright
    playwright install chromium
The pip package alone does not include a browser binary; `playwright
install chromium` downloads it separately. See README.md's Installation
section for the same note in the place a fresh clone is more likely to see
it before ever importing this module.

All 5 pieces of the original plan are implemented (batch 1: #2 + #5; batch 2:
#1; batch 3: #3 + #4):

  1. RUNTIME API CAPTURE -> recon/<target>/browser/api-calls.json
     Headless Chromium session (optionally authenticated via the same
     AuthSession headers hunt.py uses). Visits a bounded, scope-checked set
     of entry URLs plus same-scope links discovered on those pages, and
     captures every fetch/XHR/navigation request the page itself makes via
     Playwright's page.route() interception — the ONE thing a crawler-based
     pipeline structurally cannot see, because it never executes the page's
     JS. Records method, URL, request/response body SHAPE (keys + types,
     never real values), which headers looked auth-related (names only,
     values redacted), and which page/link triggered each request.
     WebSocket connection URLs are recorded too (frame contents are not).
     Requires Playwright — see require_playwright() below.

  2. SOURCE MAP RECOVERY -> recon/<target>/browser/sources/
     For each JS bundle in recon/<target>/urls/js_files.txt: fetch it, find
     its source map (sourceMappingURL comment or the conventional `.map`
     guess), unpack sourcesContent to recover original TS/JSX. Pure HTTP
     (requests), no browser needed.

  3. FRAMEWORK ROUTE EXTRACTION -> recon/<target>/browser/routes.json
     Next.js's __NEXT_DATA__ (server-rendered into the raw HTML) and
     _buildManifest.js/_ssgManifest.js (static assets once the buildId is
     known); React Router/Angular route tables via `path: "..."` literals
     that tend to survive minification; lazy-loaded chunks via dynamic
     `import(...)` across all three frameworks. Pure HTTP, no browser
     needed — every source here is static content, not something that only
     exists after JS executes.

  4. CLIENT-SIDE AUTH MODEL ANALYSIS -> recon/<target>/browser/auth-model.json
     Where tokens live (localStorage/sessionStorage key NAMES + cookie
     flags — httpOnly/secure/sameSite — never values), role/permission
     constant-naming conventions found in bundle text, and (cross-
     referencing #1/#3 if they've run) candidate refresh/logout endpoints
     and client-side routes that look privileged. Requires Playwright for
     the storage/cookie inspection; never clicks a logout button or
     actively tests whether a route's guard is real — that is hunting, not
     recon, and stays out of this module on purpose.

  5. HIDDEN ENDPOINT DISCOVERY -> recon/<target>/browser/never-called.json
     Diff: endpoints referenced in bundles (recon_engine.sh's js/endpoints.txt
     plus anything #2 recovered) MINUS endpoints actually crawled/called
     (urls/all.txt, urls/api_endpoints.txt, urls/with_params.txt, and
     browser/api-calls.json from #1). Newly-found endpoints are appended to
     urls/api_endpoints.txt — the exact file tools/lead_board.py's
     gather_recon() already globs — so `lead_board.py ingest` routes them
     through the normal pipeline. No parallel storage mechanism.

SAFETY — every outbound request in this module goes through Fetcher, which is
the single choke point: scope_checker.is_in_scope() first (browsers/crawlers
follow links off-target — the #1 way to get banned from a program), then
memory/audit_log.py's AutopilotGuard (circuit breaker + safe-method policy)
and RateLimiter, then the request, then guard feedback + an audit log entry.
--no-mutate (default ON) blocks non-idempotent methods outright — there's no
human in a headless recon run to approve them. A global --max-requests cap
and a per-request --timeout bound total exposure. For #1 specifically:
Fetcher.check() (scope + circuit-breaker + safe-method + rate-limit, no
actual I/O) runs inside a page.route() handler for EVERY request the browser
tries to make — navigation, fetch, XHR, asset loads, all of it — and a
non-conforming request is route.abort()'d before Playwright ever sends it
over the wire. #4 installs the identical page.route() gate for its one
navigation even though it isn't persisting that traffic itself (#1 owns
api-calls.json) — no browser-driving function in this module is exempt.
Only method/URL/header-name/body-shape are ever recorded; storage/cookie
inspection in #4 reads a value only long enough to compute a boolean
(looks-like-a-JWT) or a length, then discards it. tools/auth_session.py's
AuthSession already guarantees raw credential values never leave process
memory, and this module never asks it for anything but its redacted/shape
views.
