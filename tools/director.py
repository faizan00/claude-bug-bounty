Research Director — Phase 2 orchestration layer.

Problem this solves: recon-ranker.md scores classes/endpoints, and
hypothesis-engine.md generates named hypotheses, but nothing turns that
into an *executable, time-boxed plan* with explicit negative space (what
we are NOT doing and why), dependency-aware scheduling, and a mandatory
falsifier on every attack. That's this module's whole job. It generates
zero new hypotheses and computes zero new scores — it converts leads that
already exist (lead board + Phase 1 browser intelligence) into ordered,
falsifiable, time-budgeted attacks.

ONE FORMULA: every priority/EV number in this file is the unmodified
return of memory.vuln_intelligence.priority_score() / expected_value_per_hour().
This module never recomputes those; it only reads, orders, and explains.

detection_risk: deliberately NOT a field anywhere in this module. There is
no measured or persisted detection-risk signal anywhere in this codebase
(checked tools/waf_response_analyzer.py — an active-fingerprinting tool
with no persisted per-target output to read at planning time; and
memory/audit_log.py's RateLimiter/CircuitBreaker — runtime execution
guards, not a pre-computed score). Rather than fabricate a 0-1 float,
only `risk_level` (LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH) exists, computed from a small,
explicitly-labeled static heuristic (see risk_level_for()) — not a
measured value, same treatment as cold-start confidence in confidence().

Pure library + thin CLI: no input(), no prompts, JSON in/out — same
convention as memory/vuln_intelligence.py and memory/finding_score.py.

#
# Phase 1's four artifacts (recon/<target>/browser/*.json) sit there as
# passive data until something turns them into attack candidates. Every
# URL-shaped signal is run through lead_board.route_observation() — the
# SAME classifier ingest() already uses for ordinary recon URLs — instead
# of hand-rolling new routing rules. Bare paths (framework routes, browser
# recon's own privileged-route candidates) are joined against a synthetic
# https://<target> base first since route_observation()'s patterns expect
# a scheme. Role/permission constants have no URL shape and no existing
# classifier, so those get one minimal, explicitly-labeled lead each.
#
# These are transient: they're candidate pools for THIS build_plan() call,
# never written to memory/leads/<target>.jsonl. Only browser_recon.py's own
# discover_hidden_endpoints() (never-called.json) already has a deliberate,
# separate persistence path into urls/api_endpoints.txt, feeding the
# ordinary lead_board.py ingest() the next time a hunter runs it — this
# function does not duplicate or bypass that; it just also scores these
# signals for THIS plan without mutating shared lead-board state.
#
# NOTE (documented gap, not silently dropped): the Phase 2 spec's example
# list for browser-intelligence leads includes "feature flags". Verified:
# tools/browser_recon.py has no feature-flag extractor of any kind today —
# no lead type is synthesized for it here. Source-map discoveries are
# already covered transitively: recovered sources under browser/sources/
# already feed discover_hidden_endpoints() and extract_framework_routes(),
# both of which this function already reads via never-called.json/routes.json.

# sources/ from Phase 1, and recon/<target>/cicd/ from cicd_scanner.sh via
# recon_engine.sh's Phase 8) are BOTH already deterministic, recon_dir-

# wiring: called unconditionally in build_plan(), no opt-in directory
# param, [] when neither source exists yet.

# Every secrets_scanner.py finding `category` -> (existing hunt-* skill,
# lead_board priority). No new skill names invented — all four already
# exist and are already routed by lead_board.py's own ROUTES table for the
# same kind of signal (source leaks, internal API surface, gated features,
# GraphQL). Priority is keyed on the finding CATEGORY (a factual
# classification of what was found), the same convention browser_intel_
# leads() already uses when it hardcodes P_MED for a role/permission
# constant above — NOT derived from secrets_scanner.py's evidence_type/
# method fields. Those two fields describe provenance/mechanism (see that
# module's EVIDENCE TYPING docstring section); turning a type into a
# number happens ONLY in priority_score()/memory/attack_graph.py, never
