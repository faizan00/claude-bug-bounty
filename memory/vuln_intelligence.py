"""
Vulnerability intelligence layer — the memory-driven half of ranking.

Builds on the same JSONL + schema-validation + flock design as pattern_db.py,
but adds three things patterns.jsonl alone can't give you:

  * FailedPatternDB   — techniques that were tried and did NOT pan out
                         (hunt-memory/failed_patterns.jsonl). Lets recon-ranker
                         and autopilot skip a dead end instead of re-suggesting it.
  * ChainDB           — confirmed multi-signal exploit chains
                         (hunt-memory/chains.jsonl), so a chain shape that paid
                         off on one target can be recognized on the next.
                         chain_priority()/ChainDB.rank() score chains by
                         impact/probability/effort (high/high/low ranks
                         first) instead of only raw payout.
  * ReportOutcomeDB   — what submitted reports actually turned into
                         (hunt-memory/report_outcomes.jsonl): accepted, N/A'd,
                         duplicate. Lets report-writer learn which vuln
                         classes/wording convert to paid reports.
  * tech_vuln_affinity / endpoint_shape_stats — pure query functions that turn
    patterns.jsonl + failed_patterns.jsonl (+ optionally journal.jsonl) into a
    tech-stack -> vuln-class affinity ranking and an endpoint-shape hit rate,
    without a separate cache file. The intelligence is derived, not duplicated.
  * priority_score    — the autopilot decision-engine formula (impact +
                         historical success + tech match + chain probability -
                         failure penalty), one canonical implementation shared
                         by recon-ranker and autopilot instead of two
                         independently-drifting scoring formulas.
  * expected_value_per_hour — wraps priority_score with real payout
                         probability (report_outcomes.jsonl) and an
                         estimated-testing-time cost, so recon-ranker can
                         answer "which P1 pays off fastest," not just
                         "which P1 scores highest."
  * duplicate_or_noise_check — has this target+vuln_class+endpoint already
                         been found (journal.jsonl), reported
                         (report_outcomes.jsonl), or already died here
                         (failed_patterns.jsonl)? The memory-backed half of
                         validation-engine's duplicate/noise filter.
  * HypothesisDB / hypothesis_calibration — logs every hypothesis
                         hypothesis-engine generates with its stated
                         confidence (hunt-memory/hypotheses.jsonl), then
                         checks that confidence against what journal.jsonl /
                         report_outcomes.jsonl say actually happened. Closes
                         the reasoning-quality feedback loop: a vuln class
                         whose 80-100%-confidence hypotheses only convert
                         40% of the time should get less trust next time,
                         not the same blind confidence forever.

Agents that only have bash/read/glob/grep (no python execution) reach this
through the CLI at the bottom: `python3 -m memory.vuln_intelligence <cmd>`.

    failed) then pulls it down — a real hit drives the score to 0, a hard
    kill signal matching recon-ranker's failed-pattern rule.

    This is the single source of truth for "which endpoint/vuln-class goes
    first" — both recon-ranker and autopilot call this (via the CLI) instead
    of each re-deriving their own formula.

    tech_attack_matrix (optional, default None): tools/tech_attack_matrix.json
    already loaded as a dict. Only ever consulted when there's no real
    patterns/failed_patterns experience for this tech_stack+vuln_class pair
    yet — see _matrix_technology_match() above. Omitting it reproduces the
    exact behavior this function had before the parameter existed.

    dedup_probability_result (optional, default None): a dedup_probability()
    return dict the caller already computed (same "caller passes an
    already-computed dict" shape as tech_attack_matrix). Only applied when
    its sample_size clears MIN_SAMPLES_FOR_DEDUP_PROBABILITY — the cold-start
    0.5 guess never silently discounts a score. Omitting it, or passing a
    cold-start result, reproduces the exact score this function had before
    the parameter existed.

    dedup_penalty's cap deliberately reuses MAX_IMPACT_RECALIBRATION_WEIGHT
    (0.5) — the SAME existing "real data can pull a prior at most halfway"
    constant _recalibrated_impact() already uses above, applied here to the
    pre-penalty base score instead of the impact prior. No new heuristic
    constant: dedup_penalty = base * MAX_IMPACT_RECALIBRATION_WEIGHT *
    probability, so a near-certain (probability~1.0) duplicate signal can
    discount at most half of the pre-penalty base, scaled by how confident
    the duplicate-rate evidence actually is — never a flat, unexplained
    point value, and never enough alone to zero a score the way a hard
    failure_penalty (a proven dead end, a categorically stronger signal)
    does.

    endpoint / journal_entries (optional, both default None): when
    ``endpoint`` is given, calls endpoint_shape_stats() (the SAME
    normalize_endpoint()-based cross-target shape matcher
    duplicate_or_noise_check() and dedup_leads() already use) and applies
    ENDPOINT_SHAPE_LOSING_PENALTY once sample_size clears
    MIN_SAMPLES_FOR_ENDPOINT_SHAPE_PENALTY and losses outnumber wins for
    this exact shape — the flat -15 agents/recon-ranker.md already
    documents and hand-applies, now also applied in code so director.py's
    deterministic build_plan() gets it too. journal_entries is a caller-
    supplied list (mem["journal"] in director.py) since this function has
