"""
Finding lifecycle engine — SUSPECTED -> TESTING -> VALIDATED -> CONFIRMED ->
SELF_CRITIQUED -> REPORT_READY (plus REJECTED, reachable from any non-terminal
state), backed
by an append-only hunt-memory/finding_states.jsonl transition log, the same
JSONL + schema-validation + flock pattern every other file in this package
uses (patterns.jsonl, chains.jsonl, hypotheses.jsonl, experiments.jsonl,
...). Not a new memory system — one more entry type in the existing one.

Right now nothing in the pipeline enforces that a finding actually earned
its way to CONFIRMED or REPORT_READY — a hunter (or an autonomous loop) can
just declare a finding confirmed. This module makes that a checked
transition instead of a label:

  * can_transition(current, next, evidence)  — is current -> next even a
                                                legal jump, and does the
                                                evidence support it? Returns
                                                {allowed, reason} instead of
                                                raising, for callers that
                                                want to report why.
  * transition(current, next, evidence)      — same check, raises
                                                FindingStateError instead.
  * FindingStateDB                           — the persisted transition
                                                history, current_state()
                                                lookup, and advance() (the
                                                validate+persist combo) keyed
                                                by (target, vuln_class,
                                                endpoint shape).

Integrates directly with the existing validation-engine agent
(agents/validation-engine.md), which already outputs a STRONG/WEAK/REJECT
verdict and a "Reproducible?" check per finding — that verdict and
reproducibility flag are exactly the ``evidence`` dict this module expects.
Two rules enforced regardless of what order a caller tries to advance a
finding through:

  * "Weak evidence cannot become CONFIRMED" — a transition to CONFIRMED
    requires evidence["verdict"] == "STRONG". A WEAK/REJECT verdict, or no
    verdict recorded at all, blocks it.
  * "Missing reproduction blocks REPORT_READY" — a transition to
    REPORT_READY requires evidence["reproducible"] is True.

  Both of the above are necessary but no longer sufficient. A bare
  evidence["verdict"]/["reproducible"] value is just a string/bool the
  calling agent constructs itself — nothing tied it to a real
  validation-engine or self_critique.py run. CONFIRMED additionally
  requires evidence["validation_report_path"] + ["validation_report_hash"]
  naming a persisted tools/validation_core.py evaluate_finding()-shaped
  JSON report (overall_pass: true) whose CURRENT on-disk sha256 matches
  the hash; REPORT_READY additionally requires evidence
  ["self_critique_report_path"] + ["self_critique_report_hash"] naming a
  persisted tools/self_critique.py self_critique()-shaped JSON report
  (overall in "pass"/"warn") under the same hash-bound scheme. See
  write_report_artifact()/verify_report_artifact() below — the hash binds
  the evidence to the EXACT bytes on disk at verification time, so a
  missing file, a wrong path, or a file edited/swapped after the hash was
  recorded all fail closed with a clear reason instead of silently
  trusting a label.

  A follow-up hardening pass closed the gap those two checks still left
  open: tools/validation_core.py's four gates are themselves entirely
  self-reported booleans, and gate3's curl_poc is only checked for being a
  non-blank string — it is never executed against the live endpoint. A
  caller could set every gate to true, hash that JSON, and legally reach
  CONFIRMED with zero independent verification that the bug is real.
  CONFIRMED now ALSO requires the same self_critique_report_path/hash
  artifact SELF_CRITIQUED already required, specifically with its
  reproducibility check ("details.reproducibility.status") having PASSED —
  i.e. tools/self_critique.py's real, live, twice-replayed HTTP
  reproduction (through a scope/rate-limit-gated Fetcher, already tested in
  tests/test_self_critique.py and exercised against a real server in
  tests/test_e2e_hunt_loop.py) must run and independently confirm the bug
  BEFORE a finding is labeled CONFIRMED, not only afterward while gating
  the later SELF_CRITIQUED/REPORT_READY stages. The same artifact a caller
  builds for this satisfies SELF_CRITIQUED's existing requirement too, so
  in practice one self_critique.py run (persisted once) covers both gates.
  A known, disclosed trade-off inherited unchanged from
  tools/self_critique.py's own existing design: a finding whose
  validation_plan has no machine-executable {method,url} step (e.g. a bug
  only reproducible via browser JS interaction or multi-step business
  logic) cannot satisfy this check and so cannot reach CONFIRMED through
  this automated path — self_critique.py already treats an unverifiable
  claim as a block rather than a silent pass, and this fix does not change
  that policy, only when it applies.

Self-learning (FindingStateDB.advance()'s auto_learn, default on): landing
on REJECTED or CONFIRMED automatically writes to failed_patterns.jsonl /
patterns.jsonl (the same two files vuln_intelligence.py's
tech_vuln_affinity()/priority_score() already read), so a hunter never has
to run a separate `/remember` step to make a rejection or confirmation
count toward future ranking.

Agents that only have bash/read/glob/grep (no python execution) reach this
through the CLI at the bottom: `python3 -m memory.finding_state <cmd>`.
